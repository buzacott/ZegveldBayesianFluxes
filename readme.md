This repo hosts the data and analysis code for the manuscript under review:
"Buzacott et al. A Bayesian inference approach to determine experimental Typha
latifolia paludiculture greenhouse gas exchange measured with eddy covariance.",
submitted to the Agriculturl and Forest meteorology journal. [A preprint is
available at SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4676190).

The script `zegveld_bayesian_fluxes.R` runs the model and generates the main
outputs which can then analysed in the Rmarkdown notebook
`zegveld_bayesian_partitioning_results.Rmd`. Essential model functions are in
the `src` directory and the `data` directory contains preprocessed for Zegveld.
